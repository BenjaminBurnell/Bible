      "verse": "24",
      "text": "What's presentable doesn't need such covering up. God has so arranged the body that more honor is given to the parts that are less presentable."
    },
    {
      "verse": "25",
      "text": "This is so there wouldn't be any conflict within the body—the different parts should care equally for each other."
    },
    {
      "verse": "26",
      "text": "So when one part is suffering, all the other parts of the body suffer with it, and when one part is treated well, then all the other parts of the body are happy too!"
