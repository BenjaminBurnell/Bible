    {
      "verse": "2",
      "text": "You burn with desire, but don't get what you want. You kill for what you lust after, but don't get what you're looking for. You argue and you fight, but you don't get anything, because you don't pray for it."
    },
    {
      "verse": "3",
      "text": "You pray, but don't receive anything, because you ask with a wrong motive, wanting to spend what you'd receive on your selfish pleasures."

    {
      "verse": "11",
      "text": "Friends, don't speak badly of one another. Anyone who criticizes a fellow-believer and condemns them, criticizes and condemns the law. If you condemn the law you're not someone who keeps the law, because you're sitting in judgment of it."

    {
      "verse": "12",
      "text": "There's only one lawgiver and judge—the one who can either save or destroy you—so who are you to judge your neighbor?"
