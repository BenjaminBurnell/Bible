    {
      "verse": "2",
      "text": "God gives wealth, possessions, and honor to someone. They have everything they want. But God doesn't let them enjoy what they have. Instead somebody else does! This is hard to fathom, and is truly evil."

      "verse": "3",
      "text": "A man could have one hundred children, and grow old, but it wouldn't matter how long his life was if he couldn't enjoy it and at the end receive a decent burial. I would say that a stillborn child would be better off than him."
    },
    {
      "verse": "4",
      "text": "The way a stillborn child comes into the world and then leaves is painfully hard to understand—arriving and departing in darkness—and who he would have been is never known."

      "text": "He never saw the light of day or knew what it was like to live. Yet the child finds rest, and not this man."

      "verse": "9",
      "text": "Be happy with what you have instead of running after what you don't! But this is also hard to do, like running after the wind."
