      "verse": "2",
      "text": "For we've heard the good news just like they did, but it didn't help them because they didn't accept and trust in what they heard."

    {
      "verse": "3",
      "text": "However, those of us who trust in God have entered into that rest God mentioned when he said, “In my frustration I vowed, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’” (This is so even though God's plans were already complete when he created the world.)"

      "verse": "16",
      "text": "So we should go confidently to God on his throne of grace so we can receive mercy, and discover grace to help us when we really need it."
