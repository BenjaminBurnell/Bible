    },
    {
      "verse": "2",
      "text": "Abraham gave him a tithe of all that he had won. Melchizedek's name means “king of right” while king of Salem means “king of peace.”"

    {
      "verse": "3",
      "text": "We don't have any information about his father or his mother or his family tree. We don't know when he was born or when he died. Like the Son of God he continues as a priest forever."
    },
    {
      "verse": "4",
      "text": "Think how great this man was for Abraham the patriarch to give him a tithe of what was won in battle."

      "verse": "5",
      "text": "Yes, the sons of Levi who are priests were commanded by the law to receive a tithe from the people, their brothers and sisters, who are descended from Abraham."

      "verse": "8",
      "text": "In the one case tithes are received by men who die, but in the other by one who is said to be living."

    },
    {
      "verse": "11",
      "text": "Now if perfection could have been achieved through the priesthood of Levi (for that's how the law was received), what was the need for another priest to come following the order of Melchizedek, and not following the order of Aaron?"
    },
    {
      "verse": "12",
      "text": "If the priesthood is changed, then the law needs to be changed too."

      "verse": "16",
      "text": "and who didn't become a priest by virtue of his human ancestry but by the power of a life that cannot be ended."

      "verse": "17",
      "text": "That's why it says, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”"

      "verse": "18",
      "text": "So the previous rule has been set aside because it was powerless and didn't work,"

      "verse": "19",
      "text": "(for the law didn't make anything perfect). But now it's been replaced by a better hope by which we can come close to God."

      "verse": "20",
      "text": "This was not without an oath, even though those who become priests do so without an oath."
    },
    {
      "verse": "21",
      "text": "But he became a priest with an oath because God told him, “The Lord has taken a solemn vow and will not change his mind: You are a priest forever.”"

      "verse": "27",
      "text": "Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a daily sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people. He did this once, and for everyone, when he offered himself."
