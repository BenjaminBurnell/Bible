      "verse": "3",
      "text": "As a result the land dries up, and everyone who lives there is wasting away, along with the wild animals and the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea—they are all dying."
    },
    {
      "verse": "4",
      "text": "But no one should accuse or blame anyone else. My quarrel is with you the priests—you are the ones responsible."
    },

      "verse": "7",
      "text": "The more there were of them, the more they sinned against me, so I will change their glory into shame."

    },
    {
      "verse": "12",
      "text": "My people consult their wooden idols and their divining rods give them answers, for a spirit of prostitution makes them go astray. Prostituting themselves, they have deserted their God."
    },
    {
      "verse": "13",
      "text": "They offer sacrifices on the tops of mountains; they burn incense in the hills under the oak, poplar, and terebinth trees where the shade is pleasant. That's the reason why your daughters practice prostitution and your daughters-in-law commit adultery."
    },
    {
      "verse": "14",
      "text": "I will not punish your daughters when they practice prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because you men visit whores and sacrifice with temple prostitutes. A people who lack understanding end up in disaster."
