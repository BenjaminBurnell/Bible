    {
      "verse": "4",
      "text": "Of course not! Even if everyone else is proved to be lying, God always tells the truth. As Scripture says, “What you say will be proved right, and you will win your case when you are judged.”"

    },
    {
      "verse": "9",
      "text": "So then, are we Jews better than others? Definitely not! Remember that we've already argued that both Jews and foreigners are under the control of sin."

      "verse": "20",
      "text": "For no one is made right before God by doing what the law requires. The law only helps us recognize what sin really is."

      "verse": "21",
