    },
    {
      "verse": "12",
      "text": "Now if even their failure benefits the world, and their loss profits the foreigners, how much more beneficial it would be if they were to completely fulfill what they were meant to be."

      "verse": "19",
      "text": "You could make the claim, “Branches were broken off so I could be grafted in.”"

      "verse": "20",
      "text": "All well and good—but they were broken off because of their failure to trust in God, and you stay there because you trust in God. So don't think highly of yourselves, but be respectful,"

      "verse": "24",
      "text": "If you could be cut from a wild olive tree, and then be grafted artificially onto a cultivated olive tree, how much more easily they could be grafted back naturally to their own tree."

    {
      "verse": "25",
      "text": "I don't want you, my brothers and sisters to miss this previously-hidden truth, for otherwise you could become conceited. The people of Israel have become hard-hearted in part, until the process of the foreigners coming in is complete."

    {
      "verse": "26",
